La variable de salida es attrition, la cual tiene dos posibles valores, 'Yes' o 'No', por lo que estamos ante un problema de clasificación binaria. Como puede observarse, el problema es desbalanceado, encontrando que un 83,87% de las instancias pertenecen a la clase 'No' (attrition = 'No'), por lo que significa que un modelo trivial tendría un acierto del 83,87% si clasificara todos los datos como 'No'."
